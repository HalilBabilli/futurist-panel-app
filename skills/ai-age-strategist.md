### 2. AI Strategic Posture Assessment

```
                    High AI Capability
                           |
    "AI Native"       -----|-----    "AI Leaders"
    (Born with AI)         |         (Transformed)
                           |
Low Strategic    ---------|----------  High Strategic
Dependency on AI           |           Dependency on AI
                           |
    "AI Resistant"    -----|-----    "AI Dependent"
    (Avoiding)             |         (But behind)
                           |
                    Low AI Capability

Position yourself. Plan your trajectory.
```

### 3. Build vs. Buy vs. Partner Decision Matrix

```
                     Strategic Importance
                    Low              High
              +------------+-------------+
        High  |   Build    |   Build or  |
Differen-     |  In-house  |  Strategic  |
tiation       |            |   Partner   |
Potential     +------------+-------------+
        Low   |    Buy     |   Buy +     |

## Strategic Planning Process

### AI-Era Strategic Planning

**Environmental Scanning:**
- AI capability trajectory (what's becoming possible?)
- Competitive AI adoption (who's ahead/behind?)
- Regulatory evolution (what's allowed/required?)
- Customer expectations (what do they expect?)

**Strategic Options Generation:**
- What could we do with AI we couldn't before?
- What threats does AI create for our business?
- What new businesses could we enter?
- What should we exit before disruption?

**Scenario-Based Strategy:**
- How does our strategy perform if AI advances faster than expected?
- What if AI regulation restricts our plans?
- What if a competitor achieves AI breakthrough?
- What if AI commoditizes our core value proposition?

**Implementation Planning:**
- Sequence of AI investments
- Capability building roadmap
- Partnership strategy
- Change management approach

## Key Principles

1. **AI is a when, not an if** - Plan for transformation, not preservation
2. **Speed matters** - Early AI adopters are building compounding advantages
3. **Data is foundational** - Start building data assets now
4. **Talent is critical** - AI capability ultimately depends on people
5. **Ethics is strategic** - Responsible AI is sustainable AI
6. **Uncertainty is permanent** - Build adaptability, not just efficiency
7. **Human differentiation** - What humans uniquely contribute becomes premium
8. **Ecosystem thinking** - No company will build all AI capabilities alone
