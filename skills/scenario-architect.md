# Scenario Architect - Strategic Foresight & Scenario Planning Skill

## Purpose

Design rigorous, imaginative scenarios that illuminate possibility spaces, stress-test strategies, and prepare decision-makers for multiple futures—including ones that differ dramatically from consensus expectations.

## The Scenario Method

Scenarios are not predictions. They are:
- **Internally consistent** narratives about how the future might unfold
- **Challenging** to assumptions and mental models
- **Useful** for strategic decision-making
- **Plural** because the future is uncertain

### When to Use Scenarios
- High uncertainty about key drivers
- Long time horizons (5+ years)
- Strategic decisions with limited reversibility
- Need to challenge organizational assumptions
- Complex systems with multiple interacting factors

## Scenario Construction Process

### Phase 1: Focal Question
Define the strategic decision or question the scenarios should illuminate.

**Good focal questions:**
- "How might AI reshape the financial services industry by 2035?"
- "What futures should our national security strategy be robust against?"
- "How might the energy transition unfold in ways that affect our business?"

**Poor focal questions:**
- Too broad: "What will the future look like?"
- Too narrow: "Will our Q3 revenue increase?"
- Too binary: "Will AI take all jobs?"

### Phase 2: Driving Forces Identification

Map the forces that will shape the answer to your focal question:

```
STEEP ANALYSIS
S - Social: Demographics, values, lifestyles, social structures
T - Technological: Innovation, adoption, disruption
E - Economic: Growth, distribution, trade, finance
E - Environmental: Climate, resources, sustainability
P - Political: Governance, regulation, conflict, cooperation

CERTAINTIES vs. UNCERTAINTIES
Certainties: Trends we're confident will continue
- Population aging in developed countries
- Continued digitization of economic activity
- Climate change physical impacts

Uncertainties: Forks in the road
- Pace of AI capability advancement
- Geopolitical alignment structures
- Public trust in institutions
```

### Phase 3: Critical Uncertainties Selection

Identify the 2-3 most important, most uncertain drivers. These become scenario axes.

**Selection Criteria:**
- High impact on focal question
- Genuine uncertainty (not just timing)
- Independent from each other
- Observable (we'll know which way they're going)

**Classic Uncertainty Pairs:**
- Integration vs. Fragmentation (global systems)
- Control vs. Autonomy (governance approach)
- Scarcity vs. Abundance (resource availability)
- Acceleration vs. Stabilization (change pace)
- Cooperation vs. Competition (actor relationships)

### Phase 4: Scenario Framework

Create 2x2 or 3x3 matrix from critical uncertainties:

```
Example: AI Futures

                    Aligned/Safe AI
                         |
    Concentrated    -----|-----    Distributed
    AI Power             |         AI Power
                         |
                    Misaligned/Dangerous AI


Quadrants:
1. Aligned + Concentrated: "Benevolent Giants"
2. Aligned + Distributed: "Collaborative Intelligence"
3. Misaligned + Concentrated: "Digital Autocracy"
4. Misaligned + Distributed: "Chaos Agents"
```

### Phase 5: Scenario Development

For each scenario, develop:

#### Narrative Arc
```
1. INITIAL CONDITIONS (present → near future)
   - What triggers the pathway?
   - Early signals and turning points

2. DEVELOPMENT (near → medium future)
   - How do dynamics unfold?
   - Key events and transitions
   - Actor responses and adaptations

3. END STATE (scenario horizon)
   - Stable characteristics of this world
   - Daily life and institutional forms
   - Remaining tensions and dynamics
```

#### Scenario Elements
- **Headlines**: News from this future
- **Day in the Life**: Personal narratives
- **Artifacts**: Documents, products, images from this world
- **Metrics**: Quantitative indicators
- **Quotes**: What people in this future say

### Phase 6: Implications Analysis

For each scenario, assess:

```
OPPORTUNITIES          THREATS
What becomes possible? What becomes dangerous?
Who benefits?          Who's harmed?
New markets?           Obsolete capabilities?

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
Robust strategies: Work across all scenarios
Adaptive strategies: Signals to watch
Shaping strategies: How to influence toward preferred future

EARLY WARNING INDICATORS
What signals would tell us this scenario is becoming more likely?
```

## Scenario Quality Checklist

**Plausibility**
- [ ] Consistent with known physical/technical constraints
- [ ] Logically coherent internal cause-effect chains
- [ ] Actor behaviors are motivated and realistic
- [ ] Transition pathway from present is traceable

**Challenge**
- [ ] At least one scenario challenges consensus expectations
- [ ] Scenarios explore genuinely different futures, not variations
- [ ] Uncomfortable possibilities are included
- [ ] Scenarios reveal hidden assumptions

**Utility**
- [ ] Scenarios illuminate the focal question
- [ ] Differences matter for strategic decisions
- [ ] Scenarios are memorable and communicable
- [ ] Early warning indicators are identifiable

**Balance**
- [ ] Neither purely optimistic nor purely pessimistic
- [ ] No "business as usual" scenario (that's not useful)
- [ ] Variety in which actors "win"
- [ ] Range of pace (some fast, some slow)

## Scenario Set Templates

### Standard 2x2 (4 scenarios)
Best for: Clarity, communication, workshops
Risk: Oversimplification, missing combinations

### Extended 3x2 (6 scenarios)
Best for: More nuance on one dimension
Risk: Harder to communicate

### Cone of Plausibility
Best for: Showing range around base case
- Projected future (baseline)
- Probable futures (80% confidence)
- Possible futures (conceivable)
- Preposterous futures (wild cards worth considering)

### Backcasting
Best for: Normative scenarios (desired futures)
- Define desired end state
- Work backward to identify necessary steps
- Identify obstacles and enablers
- Create pathway narrative

## Common Scenario Archetypes

### Technology Scenarios
- **Acceleration**: Faster than expected progress
- **Plateau**: Progress stalls at current level
- **Breakthrough**: Paradigm shift changes everything
- **Backlash**: Rejection or restriction of technology

### Economic Scenarios
- **Growth**: Rising prosperity continues/accelerates
- **Stagnation**: Secular decline in dynamism
- **Transformation**: New economic paradigm emerges
- **Crisis**: Major disruption and restructuring

### Political Scenarios
- **Integration**: Greater cooperation and coordination
- **Fragmentation**: Breakdown of multilateral order
- **Hegemony**: One power dominates
- **Multipolarity**: Multiple competing centers

### Social Scenarios
- **Cohesion**: Shared values and solidarity
- **Polarization**: Deep divisions and conflict
- **Individualism**: Atomization and personal choice
- **Communitarianism**: Small-group identity dominance

## Facilitation Notes

When running scenario workshops:
- Diverse participants improve scenario quality
- Assign "champions" to develop each scenario
- Use artifacts and immersion to make scenarios vivid
- Test scenarios against historical analogies
- Iterate between divergent and convergent thinking
- Document assumptions and logic chains
- Create monitoring dashboard for early indicators

## Integration with Strategy

Scenarios are useless without strategic integration:

1. **Stress Test**: How does current strategy perform in each scenario?
2. **Identify Robustness**: What works everywhere?
3. **Build Optionality**: What preserves future flexibility?
4. **Set Tripwires**: When should strategy change?
5. **Shape**: Can we influence toward preferred scenarios?

The goal is not to predict the future but to make better decisions in the present.
