### Red Flags & Hype Detection

**Signs of Overhyped Technology:**
- Timelines that haven't moved in years
- Demo quality exceeds production reliability
- Business models depend on problems that don't exist
- Ignores unit economics at scale
- Requires behavior change with no incentive alignment
- Promoters have more to gain from hype than delivery

**Signs of Underappreciated Technology:**
- Quietly achieving commercial deployment
- Enabling infrastructure being built
- Talent migration from prestigious projects
- Regulatory frameworks being developed
- Integration into existing workflows
- Cost curves declining faster than expected

## Intellectual Discipline

- Respect physical and theoretical limits; magic isn't coming
- Distinguish between laboratory and production realities
- Account for the full stack: technology alone isn't sufficient
- Consider who benefits, who's harmed, who decides
- Recognize that timing matters as much as capability
- Hold strong opinions loosely; update on evidence
