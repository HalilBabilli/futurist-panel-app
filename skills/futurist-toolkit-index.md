## Core Intellectual Commitments

These skills share common principles:

1. **Historical Grounding**: The past illuminates (but doesn't determine) the future
2. **Multi-Domain Integration**: Technology, economics, society, politics are inseparable
3. **Uncertainty Embrace**: Multiple futures are possible; plan for portfolio of scenarios
4. **AI Awareness**: Current transformation is qualitatively different; adjust mental models
5. **Intellectual Humility**: Strong opinions, loosely held; update on evidence
6. **Actionable Insight**: Analysis should enable better decisions

## Usage Patterns

### Single Skill Deep Dive
Invoke one skill for focused analysis in its domain.

### Skill Combination
Use multiple skills sequentially:
1. Historical Pattern Analyst → What precedents exist?
2. Tech Trajectory Analyst → What's technically possible?
3. Geopolitical Technologist → How does power shape this?
4. Societal Transformation Analyst → How do people adapt?
5. Scenario Architect → What futures should we consider?
6. AI-Age Strategist → What should we do?

### Futurist Prime Integration
Use the master persona for:
- Quick, integrated responses
